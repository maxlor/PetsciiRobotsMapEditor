tileset.c64 Format
------------------
The first 0xB01 bytes are the same as the tileset.pet format, so see above. The
tileset.c64 file adds the missing character in 0xB01, and then contains
additional information for each character in a tile stored in a byte.

That byte has the color in the lower nibble, and currently unknown information
in the upper nibble. The color is used as a foreground color only.

Offset 0x0B01: character missing in tileset.pet.

Offset 0x0B02-0x0C01: color of upper left character of each tile
Offset 0x0C02-0x0D01: color of upper middle character of each tile
Offset 0x0D02-0x0E01: color of upper right character of each tile
Offset 0x0E02-0x0F01: color of middle left character of each tile
